No longer need a particular deployment? To archive a deployment, go to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>**. Depending on which view you are using the steps can vary: [cards](#cards-view) or [table](#table-view).

### Cards view

If you're using the **CARDS** view, click on the 3 vertical dots of your chosen deployment, select **ARCHIVE**, and confirm the archival.

### Table view

If you're using the **TABLE** view, click on the **ACTIONS** dropdown of your chosen deployment, select **Archive**, and confirm the archival.
