To delete a workspace, from the home screen, hover over the workspace name and click the trash can icon on the right hand side. From there you'll see a prompt asking you to confirm the deletion. Click `REMOVE` to delete the workspace. This action is irreversible! While your linked projects will remain safe and unchanged, the blockchain data (i.e. blocks, transactions, events, etc.) will be deleted.
